## One For All

MySQL project made while studying at Trybe, a web development school.

In this project I received a non normalized table and the goal was to normalize and populate this table in order to execute queries on it to find requested information.

### Skills Developed
With this project I was able to:

  * Model a database.

  * Identify entities, attributes and relationships.
  
  * Apply the first, second and third Normal Forms.

  * Create tables.
